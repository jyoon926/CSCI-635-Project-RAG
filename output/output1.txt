Q: What is retrieval-augmented generation?

	A: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a form of augmented reality. It can be used to help models clear up ambiguity in a user query.

	A: RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such cases. RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.7 Rouge-L points.

Q: What are the advantages of RAG-Token over RAG-Sequence in Jeopardy question generation?

	A: RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation. Both models outperform BART on Q-BLEU-1. RAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of rag - token over rag - sequence.

Q: How does RAG perform on the FEVER fact verification task?

	A: We analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We find that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71% of cases. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents and the gold evidence annotations.

Q: What are the key components of the RAG model for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks?

	A: The MSMARCO NLG task v2.1.1 consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat the task as an open-domain abstractive QA task.

Q: How does RAG combine parametric and non-parametric memories for NLP tasks?

	A: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. We find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-based baseline.

Q: What are the computational resources required for BERT and SentenceBERT in RAG models?
