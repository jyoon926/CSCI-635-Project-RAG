Q: What is the purpose of the RAG model in NLP tasks?

	A: RAG can be fine-tuned on any number of documents. It can be used to generate correct answers to questions. The model can also be used for more complex queries. It has been used in a number of NLP tasks, such as the MS-MARCO NLG task.

Q: How does the rag-sequence work compared to the rag-token model?

	A: RAG-Sequence can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document. RAG can achieve 11.8% accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%. As shown in Table 2, RAG-Token outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG.

Q: How is evaluation performed in RAG?

	A: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a form of machine learning. RAG can be used to test knowledge-based queries. The RAG model converts a query into a numeric format so machines can read it. It then compares these numeric values to vectors in a machine-readable index of an available knowledge base.
